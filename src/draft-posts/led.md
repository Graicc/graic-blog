- LED Strip types
  - This article is about non-addressable LED strips, because they're much cheaper and I don't care about individual control
  - I used 5050
  - If you want white, get one with RGBW. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYbdx4I7STg>
    - Higher end LEDs exist with adjustable white temperature, I haven't used
- Choosing firmware
  - Initially was going to use ESPHome, but WLED has everything built in and is designed for this application
  - WLED is great, web installer is great, UI is great (I'm amazed that a microcontroller can run a web server)
- Crimping connectors
  - That one video
  - JST connectors
  - Daisy chained the LEDs, which is fine because they're all in parallel anyways
- Power supply ready .95A
- Powering the system
  - LEDs power supply is 12V
  - ESP32 is 3.3V
    - Tried linear regulator, got too hot for my comfort (was dumping about 1W of energy)
    - Used buck converter, set to 5V because I had one on hand
    - Texas Instruments data sheet was great at walking through the rest of the circuit needed
    - Not naming specific components because I'm not an EE and parts were chosen for availability.
    - Wire to 5V pin on ESP32
- Wiring diagram
  - Based off of the [WLED wiring diagrams](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/compatible-led-strips/#non-addressable-led-strips)
- 3D printed case
  - Use fillets next time
  - Sanded spokes for smooth fit
- Tape method
  - how to deal with corners?
  - Failed (?) attempt with brackets
- Refresh device to update list of presets
- Automatons
  - Sunset -> evening lightning
  - iOS shortcut on alarm -> home assistant script that triggers a preset
